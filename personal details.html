<b>Background Information:</b> 
<br>
As previously shown above my name is Daniel Wilkinson, I recently just turned 29 as of the 21st of May this year. I was born in Australia grew up in the suburb of Mt Eliza, I completed high school where I attained my VCE afterwards I went on to study at Waverly Holmesglen TAFE which enabled me to receive a diploma. 

<p>Following this I studied at Deakin University allowing me to achieve a Bachelor of Environmental Science.
A fact that always surprises and interests’ people about me is the fact that I -like 12% of the male population- is that I am colour blind. I was born with it passed down from my mum and her side of the family. 

<p>No, I don’t see in black and white or grey. It’s better to think of it in terms of shades than colours, example: I can tell the difference between black and blue, but I cannot tell the difference between dark blue and purple.</p>
